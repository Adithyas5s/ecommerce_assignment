This repository contains the solution to the eCommerce Data Science Assignment. The assignment consists of three main tasks: 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
building a Lookalike Model
performing Customer Segmentation using clustering techniques.

1. Since I have used PyCharm IDE, The python files are in .py extension. If the user wants to run these programs in Jupyter notebook, the extensions should be changed to ipynb.
2. Make sure that the necessary libraries are installed - pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
3. Use the following command to install the libraries: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
4. Python Scripts
   FirstName_LastName_EDA.py: Converted Python script for EDA.
   FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.py: Converted Python script for the Lookalike Model.
   FirstName_LastName_Clustering.py: Converted Python script for Customer Segmentation.
5. Run FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.py, It generates FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv.
6. Run FirstName_LastName_EDA.py - It will generate Customer Distribution by Region, Product Categories Distribution, monthly total value of transactions and Correlation matrix of Numerical Features
7. Run FirstName_LastName_Clustering.py - It will generate Customer segments plot
